# IIA_Project_GF3_Group_1

This is the repository of a project done in the Easter term of 2022, focuing Audio Modem. The repository is forked from yichen-song, another group member.</br>
In this project, we successfully implemented the OFDM method in trasferring and receiving information using audio. We used Python scripts to implement the trasmmiter and receiver.
Our trasmitter can encode text/image/audio into a binary file, load the information on an audio file using OFDM method. Our receiver can receive the audio signal and decode the trasmitted information from it.
